--- abstract

This memo describes the code of conduct for participation in the
Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).

# Introduction

The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) promotes research of importance to
the evolution of the Internet protocols, applications, architecture and
technology. The IRTF focuses on longer term research issues related to the
Internet while the parallel organisation, the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF), focuses on the shorter term issues of engineering and
standards making.

Research is most effective when done in an open and inclusive forum that
encourages diversity of ideas and diversity of participation. The IRTF,
through this code of conduct, will continue to strive to create and
maintain an environment that encourages broad participation, and one in
which people of many different backgrounds are treated with dignity,
decency, and respect. We will work to ensure that all members of the IRTF
community feel valued and respected, regardless of their gender, race,
ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation or identity, education,
disability, or other unique characteristics.


# Conduct

The IRTF is committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all
participants. Those participating in the IRTF must extend respect and
courtesy to others at all times. 

Harassment is unwelcome, hostile, or intimidating behaviour, in particular
speech or behaviour that is sexually aggressive or that intimidates based on
attributes such as race, gender, religion, age, colour, national origin,
ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity [RFC7776].
Harassment will not be tolerated in IRTF meetings and events, or on mailing
lists and other online forums. Participants must follow the IETF
anti-harassment policy which also applies to the IRTF [ANTI-HARASSMENT].

Examples of harassment
include, but are not limited to, the use of offensive language or sexual
imagery in public presentations and displays, degrading verbal comments,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If you believe you have been harassed, notice that someone else is being
harassed, or have any other concerns, you are encouraged to raise your
concern with the relevant Research Group Chair, the IRTF Chair, or the
Ombudsteam [OMBUDSTEAM] who work on an independent and confidential basis.
All such concerns will be considered and action will be taken as appropriate,
up to and including exclusion of the offending party from IRTF activities.

The IRTF operates and makes use of a number of mailing lists and other
online discussion forums. The Research Group chairs act as moderators for
such forums used by their research groups; the IRTF Chair moderates
IRTF-wide lists and discussion forums. Harassment or disruption due to the
posting of messages that are inflammatory, abusive, or otherwise
inappropriate, or the repeated posting of off-topic material, on these lists
and discussion forums will not be tolerated.
Moderators will respond to harassing or disruptive behaviour with a warning
in the first instance, but thereafter may temporarily or permanently
suspend posting rights for any individual engaging in such behaviour.

# Language and Imagery

English is the de facto language in which the IRTF works, but is not the
native language of many IRTF participants. All participants, particularly
those with English as a first language, should attempt to accommodate the
needs of others by communicating clearly.

Participants should aim to speak slowly and clearly in presentations and
discussions, and should strive to make presentations and other materials
accessible to those with impaired vision or disabilities. Participants
should also avoid the use of slang and unnecessary jargon in both spoken
and written communication. When faced with English that is difficult to
understand, IRTF participants should make a sincere effort to understand
each other and to engage in conversation to clarify what was meant.

Participants should ensure that language and imagery used in IRTF
documents, presentations, mailing lists, research group meetings,
conferences, workshops, and other events, is respectful and inclusive.
Effective research uses terminology that is clear, precise, and widely
accessible to readers from varying backgrounds and cultures.  Participants
are encouraged to follow the guidance on inclusive language in [NISTIR8366]
when making contributions to the IRTF [INCLUSIVE].


# Academic Integrity

The IRTF takes academic integrity seriously. 
Participants must act with respect, honesty, transparancy, and fairness.
They should be trustworhy, aspire to objectivity, aim to provide factual
evidence in support of their claims and justification for their reasoning.
They should be generous, give credit to others where it is due, and
recognise that understanding advances through the collaborative research
efforts of many, rather than for the glory of a few.

Plagiarism, including self-plagiarism, misrepresentation of authorship, and
content falsification constitute dishonesty and fraud. Such actions are
prohibited and the IRTF may take action against authors that commit them.

The use of automated systems, for example large language models and other
AI-based tools, to generate all or part of the content of a document,
paper, presentation, or other submission to the IRTF must be documented
and credited such that it is clear what parts were generated by the
automated system. Using such tools without credit is considered a
misrepresentation of authorship.



# Participation

The IRTF seeks to encourage research relating to the development of the
Internet in all its diversity and for all its users, considering both
technical, economic, and societal challenges of such development.

To encourage broad participation, reflecting this diversity, participants
should consider accessibility and access-related concerns when organising
IRTF research group meetings, workshops, conferences, and other events.
The IRTF will work to support this by providing travel grants, fee waivers,
childcare, and other support to allow students, early career researchers,
members of under-represented groups, and others who might otherwise be
unable to participate.

Participants should work to make meeting materials available online in a
timely manner, and to ensure that such materials are broadly accessible.
Participants should work to enable remote participation in IRTF events
to support those who cannot attend in person.


# Rationale

The IRTF is not the IETF. While the two organisations work closely
together, and often co-locate meeting and other activities, they have
different goals and work in different ways.

The IETF is a consensus-driven standards developing organisation, where
participants use their best engineering judgement to find the best solution
for the whole Internet, as it stands today, and to develop the best
technical standards to make the Internet work better.
IRTF research can be more speculative, and takes a longer-term view of
the development of the Internet without the requirements for consensus
or near-term applicability and deployability that come from standards
development.

Compared to the IETF equivalent [RFC7154] this IRTF code of conduct
reflects those differences in emphasis between the two organisations.



# Security Considerations

The IRTF code of conduct does not directly affect the security of the
Internet. Researchers working in the IRTF should consider the potential
security risks and implications of their work and, where possible, should
aim to improve the security of the Internet through their research.


# IANA Considerations

This document requires no IANA actions.
